# Sensor Data Sender

This code is designed to read sensor data from an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and send it to an HTTP server. It can be used to collect and transmit sensor data from a microcontroller or IoT device to a remote server for further processing or analysis.

## Prerequisites

- This code is written in Python and requires a compatible microcontroller or IoT device with a network connection and an ADC module.
- The `machine` and `time` modules are required for running this code. Ensure that these modules are available on your device.

## Setup

1. Connect the analog sensor to the ADC input of your device.
2. Replace the `URL` variable in the code with the actual URL of the HTTP server that will receive the sensor data.
   - Example: `URL = "http://192.168.0.100:8000"`
3. Ensure that the HTTP server is capable of receiving data in the expected format.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your microcontroller or IoT device.
2. Execute the code.
3. The device will continuously read the sensor value from the ADC.
4. It will send the sensor value to the specified HTTP server using the `POST` method with the sensor value included in the request data.
5. After sending the data, the code will wait for one second before reading the sensor value again.
6. The process continues indefinitely until the code is stopped or interrupted.

## Important Notes

- Make sure that the ADC pin and the reference voltage are properly configured for accurate sensor readings.
- Adjust the sleep duration (`time.sleep(1)`) if you need a different interval between sensor readings.
- Ensure that the device has a stable network connection to successfully send the data to the HTTP server.
- Modify the code according to your specific requirements, such as adding authentication, error handling, or additional sensor readings.

## Troubleshooting

- If the code is not working as expected, check the following:
  - Verify the correctness of the URL and ensure that the HTTP server is reachable.
  - Confirm that the ADC is properly connected and configured.
  - Check the network connection of your device.
  - Inspect the HTTP server logs or response to diagnose any issues on the server side.
